          <div class="card-body">Public safety systems are government functions that aim to protect the 
  welfare of the public from risks such as emergencies, crimes, and disasters. Public safety 
  leaders and researchers have been studying how to design and operate public sector systems 
  to manage risk for the last half a century. Although researchers have created a body of 
  knowledge for supporting prescriptive and predictive decisions in the public sector, public 
  safety leaders must continually adapt to address new risks in budget-constrained environments. 
  As a result, many research challenges remain. <br/> Public sector applications are 
  complex systems that span people, processes, vehicles, and critical infrastructure, 
  where decisions are not made in isolation. Rather, decisions are interrelated, with 
  every decision potentially affecting every other decision due to congestion, processing 
  delays, capacities, and uncertainty about what can happen next. In this talk, 
  Dr. Laura Albert will discuss her research that studies how to design and operate 
  public sector systems using predictive and prescriptive analytics.  She will discuss 
  how she has connected application to theory in public sector applications in the 
  United States ranging from emergency medical services and critical infrastructure 
  protection. She will also discuss policy insights as well as insights obtained from 
  putting the results into practice in real world settings.</div>

          <div class="card-body">Hunger relief organizations are important to provide safe and nutritious 
  food to people who experience food insecurity. Predicting food demand is a challenge 
  because of its stochastic nature and the complexity of the operations of these organizations. 
  More so, the demand side of food bank operations has received less attention in the literature. 
  Therefore, this research develops a novel approach to estimate the true demand using a food 
  bank branch as a case study. Each partner agency is unique in terms of its behavior. Therefore, 
  k-means clustering was used to categorize agencies into groups based on number of persons 
  served and the amount of food received. These measures were combined with other parameters 
  like number of programs offered and frequency of visits to develop predictive models that 
  estimate the true demand. The random forest model had the best performance of the predictive 
  models considered. This research has merit for non-profit hunger relief organizations. More 
  accurate estimates of the demand will aid decision making relative to food distribution, while 
  also providing data for planning purposes. This will aid their efforts in bridging the growing 
  food insecurity gap.</div>

  these projects. One could argue that forecasting is not needed in 
  this context: the master Gantt chart of the tasks with assigned

  for an accurate estimation of the duration and cost of a project. If 
  that was the case then every project would finish on time and on 
  budget – but this is far from true as the numerous examples 
  attest: HS2, Channel Tunnel, major IT public projects in NHS, 
  to name a few. In this research, we employ judgmental forecasting methods 
  to predict the success of megaprojects in a controlled experiment  
  where the participants forecast for one megaproject (‘a major recreational facility in the very city centre of a major cosmopolis’) with Unaided Judgment (UJ), 
  Structured Analogies (SA), Delphi(D) and Interaction Groups (IG) with IG showing 
  the best results since IG&gt;D&gt;SA&gt;SA. We see separately the success in terms of 
  excesses in the budget and the duration of the project. Furthermore, 
  the participants forecast the extent to which the socio-economic benefits
  are realised. We do analyse three different stakeholder perspectives: that of the a) 
  project manager, b) funder(s), and c) the public. We do control for two levels of 
  expertise – novices, and semi-experts.</div>

  underestimated widely in most decision making settings. The second concentrates 
  on the uncertainty of medical diagnoses and the reasons of its critical importance 
  as it greatly affects medical errors. The last part considers possible solutions 
  to correct the problem and reduce its negative consequences, with a critical 
  emphasis on how to communicate diagnostic uncertainty and risks to patients and 
  provide them with sufficient information to enable them to contribute effectively 
  to decisions about their own treatment and consequently about the quality of their

          <div class="card-body">When new pathogens emerge, numerous questions arise about 
  their future spread, some of which can be addressed with probabilistic 
  forecasts. The many uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging 
  pathogens can make it difficult to choose among model structures and 
  assumptions, however. To assess the potential for uncertainties about 
  emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated 
  the performance of a suite of 16 forecasting models in the context of 
  the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different 
  combination of assumptions about the role of human mobility in driving 
  transmission, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and 
  the number of times the virus was introduced. All models used the same 
  core transmission model and the same iterative data assimilation algorithm 
  to generate forecasts. By assessing forecast performance through
  time using logarithmic scoring with ensemble weighting, we found 
  that which model assumptions had the most ensemble weight changed 
  through time. In particular, spatially coupled models had higher 
  ensemble weights in the early and late phases of the epidemic, 
  whereas non-spatial models had higher ensemble weights at the peak 
  of the epidemic. We compared forecast performance of the equally-weighted 
  ensemble model to each individual model and identified a trade-off whereby
  certain individual models outperformed the ensemble model early in the 
  epidemic, but the ensemble model outperformed all individual models on 
  average. On balance, our results suggest that suites of models that 
  span uncertainty across alternative assumptions are necessary to 
  obtain robust forecasts in the context of emerging infectious diseases.</div>
