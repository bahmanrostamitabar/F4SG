disease modeling teams from across the world who have made forecasts of
the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Launched in March 2020, the
Hub has aggregated over 200m rows of forecast data from over 90
different models. The ensemble forecast generated each week by the Hub
is used as the official forecast of the US Centers of Disease Control
and Prevention. This talk will describe the process of building and
maintaining the Hub, from the data model used to represent forecasts, to
the community-building aspects of incentivizing and recruiting dozens to
teams, and the statistical challenges in building and evaluating an
ensemble forecast in real-time. More information about the COVID-19
Forecast Hub can be found at <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/">https://covid19forecasthub.org/</a>.')

The increasing availability of data from a variety of sources, together with advancements in statistics and machine learning, is generating a growing interest in using models to gain insight and trigger anticipatory action.
Using data science to anticipate humanitarian crises represents a great opportunity for organizations to respond earlier, saving and protecting more lives than ever before. 
The Centre for Humanitarian Data of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is focusing its efforts so that the humanitarian system can reliably use models to trigger action.'

  ethical considerations including privacy concerns of those being studies/surveyed, 
  challenges associated with the representativeness of the sample under consideration,
