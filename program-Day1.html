          <div class="card-body">There has been a surge in epidemic short-term forecasting 
  during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large number of forecasting 
  approaches published and run in real time. This raises the need for 
  systematic comparison and evaluation of methods, both as a prerequisite 
  for model improvement and to assess how reliably forecasts can inform 
  public health decision making. Moreover, the large number of available 
  models opens new avenues for ensemble forecasting, as commonly used in 
  other fields like meteorology and economics. I will present results 
  from a pre-registered forecast evaluation study conducted in Germany 
  and Poland from October 2020 to April 2021. It is based on the German 
  and Polish COVID-19 Forecast Hub which, run in close collaboration with
  the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub, assembles forecasts of confirmed cases 
  and deaths one through four weeks ahead. During the study period, 
  fifteen independent research teams contributed forecasts. 
  We found pronounced heterogeneity between submitted forecasts, 
  both in terms of central tendency and degree of uncertainty,
  and considerable difficulty to anticipate inflection points. 
  Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance and were notably 
  better calibrated than individual models.</div>

  An interesting question arises: how does expert opinion alone

  against forecasts that combine expert opinion with epidemiological 
  modeling? To answer this question, we submitted crowd forecasts from 
  experts and non-experts (most participants came from within our working

          <div class="card-body">The Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) and its 
  seventh global target recognizes that increased efforts are required to 
  develop risk-informed and impact-based multi-hazard early warning systems. 
  Despite significant advances in disaster forecasting and warning technology, 
  it remains challenging to produce valuable forecasts and warnings that can be 
  understood and used to trigger early actions. Overcoming these challenges 
  requires an understanding of the reliability of forecast tools and implementation 
  barriers combined with the development of new risk-informed processes. 
  It also requires a commitment to create and share risk and impact data and 
  co-produce impact-based forecasting models and services. To deal with the 
  problem of coming into action in response to imperfect forecasts, novel 
  science-based concepts have recently emerged. The Red Cross Red Crescent 
  Movement has and is implementing with several stakeholders Forecast-based 
  financing (FbF) to reduce disaster losses and ensure reaching the objectives 
  of SFDRR. This presentation will give an overview of which impact-based 
  forecasting models are used for anticipatory action in the Red Cross for 
  different type of hazards, such as drought, cyclones and floods. 
  These models translate forecasts of various climate-related and 
  geohazards into impact-based forecasts. Finally, this presentation 
  will zoom in on cyclones and describe the context for FbF for typhoons 
  in the Philippines and introduce the three subsequent speakers of this session.</div>

          <div class="card-body">Due to its geographical location, the Philippines is highly exposed 
  to risks associated with Tropical Cyclones (TC). Every year at least one 
  TC will make a landfall resulting in a big humanitarian impact and economic loss. 
  To reduce the humanitarian impact of TC in the Philippines, the Philippine Red Cross 
  and German Red Cross designed and implemented a Forecast Based Financing (FbF) 
  system, which is a mechanism to access humanitarian finance before a disaster 
  strikes, enabling humanitarian actors to take lifesaving early actions. 
  The early actions in the FbF system are pre-identified and will be activated 
  when a trigger model indicates a pre-defined danger level will be exceeded. 
  For the FbF project in the Philippines, a danger level threshold of 10% of 
  buildings in a municipality will be completely damaged was defined by analyzing 
  historical impact data. In this presentation, we will explain the development 
  and application of a Machine Learning (ML) impact-based forecasting model which 
  is used as a triggering tool for guiding the implementation of the early action 
  defined in the PRC FBF system. The ML model predicts the percentage of damaged 
  houses per municipality with a lead time of 120 to 72hrs before TC landfall. 
  Two ML models were developed. A classification model that will predict if the 
  10% threshold is passed and hence will guide where to activate FbF early actions.
  A regression model that will identify the most impacted municipalities and that 
  can be used to prioritize interventions. For both classification and regression 
  models, multiple learning algorithms were compared. A model based on the 
  RandomForest algorithm outperformed other models for both classification and 
  regression problems for both the training and validation datasets. 
  Comparison of the machine learning model against a baseline model,
  which is a model based on physical vulnerability (damage curves), 
  showed the machine learning model has a better skill in predicting 
  percentage damage for historical typhoon events. With this case study, 
  we demonstrated the benefit of the machine learning model as a trigger 
  tool for activating FbF early actions and how this information is used 
  to guide humanitarian early actions to reduce the impact of typhoons on 
  vulnerable communities.</div>

          <div class="card-body">With an average of 22 Tropical Cyclones (TC) entering the Philippines
  Area of Responsibility on a yearly basis, they are the natural hazard with 
  the highest human and economic impact. The extreme winds and rains brought 
  by these TC's heavily affect the agricultural sector, making it the sector 
  with the largest economic damages. A specific crop of interest here is rice. 
  With rice accounting for nearly 25% of the agricultural value and it being the 
  staple food for 90% of the population, TC damage to the rice fields has a 
  significant impact on the Philippines' economy and food security. To mitigate 
  the damages caused, early action protocols that are triggered 
  by data-driven models are being developed. To this extent, areas that are in 
  the highest need of help need to be identified, emphasizing the need for 
  models that predict damages on a granular level. The key aim of this study is, therefore, to develop a model for predicting 
  the percentage area of rice fields that a TC will damage on the municipality level. 
  More specifically, we developed 1) a classification model to determine whether a 
  damage threshold of 30% is passed and 2) a regression model that predicts the 
  percentage damage. To this extent, a set of ML techniques was implemented using 
  exposure and vulnerability indicators that include geographical, socioeconomic, 
  and agricultural variables, as well as typhoon-specific hazard indicators. 
  A comparison with baseline classification and regression models shows that the ML 
  models provide an improved predictive performance, confirming their potential for
  assisting in pre-disaster fund distribution to mitigate the damages caused to 
  rice fields. Thus far, the research has been focused on the Bicol region, but 
  we are currently working on an extension to generalize the models for national coverage.</div>

          <div class="card-body">With a global paradigm shift from post-disaster response aid to 
  anticipatory action, the question on how anticipatory action relates to long-term 
  climate adaptation and often government-led actions towards permanent disaster 
  prevention becomes more relevant. With rising disaster risk, a framework that 
  decision-makers can use to select between preventive and preparedness risk 
  reduction efforts would be most useful. A model originally developed to compare 
  permanent interventions to forecast-based action for floods was applied to 
  wind-induced building damage due to tropical cyclones, focusing on a case 
  study from the Philippines. We made use of a typhoon forecasting model 
  based on the ensemble forecast from EMCWF, and modelled the wind footprint 
  to estimate both the observed and forecasted windspeed during tropical cyclone 
  events between 2006 and 2020 in the case study area. A trigger threshold was 
  defined, similar to how it is done in actual operations by the Philippine Red Cross. 
  If the forecasted windspeed exceeds a pre-set threshold in 
  terms of wind speed, action to strengthen light-weight wooden houses with a 
  Shelter Strengthening Kit (SSK) is taken. SSKs temporarily make these houses 
  more resistant to withstand extreme winds, thereby reducing the impacts. 
  This short-term action is compared to a scenario in which lightweight wooden 
  houses are permanently upgraded. Event-based losses to repair and sheltering 
  costs are estimated through damage curves. The total monetary losses that would 
  have been sustained between 2006-2020 are brought back to mean annual losses 
  to gain a better understanding of when scenarios would outweigh each other. 
  Though initial results hint at a timeframe of 19 years, it was found that 
  results are highly sensitive to variables used. Thus, an extensive sensitivity 
  analysis gives actors in humanitarian response, anticipatory action as well 
  as permanent disaster prevention insight into which variables affect this balance. 
  Building on these findings, could help policymakers to allocate their scarce 
  budgets in a cost-effective way. The framework, although developed for 
  the Philippines, can also be replicated in other cyclone-prone countries.</div>

          <div class="card-body">The collection, analysis, and use of "big" data in the humanitarian sector 
  is increasing at a rapid pace. Predictions resulting from these models are of 
  enormous use to governments, NGOs, and IGOs that work to deliver human and material 
  assistance to those in need. The use of big data, however, also comes with serious 
  ethical considerations including privacy concerns of those being studies/surveyed, 
  challenges associated with the representativeness of the sample under consideration, 
  and potential risks to vulnerable populations if forecasts are abused by state or nonstate actors.
  This roundtable brings together practitioners and academics to discuss the ethical 
  dimensions of forecasting across a range of substantive areas.</div>

  Contraceptive Use is our latest effort to improve forecasting accuracy of 
  life-saving medical products in our Global Health Supply Chain. 
  The purpose of the competition was to learn from empirical evidence how to 
  improve the forecasting accuracy and how such learning could be used to 
  advance the practice of forecasting health products in a least developed 
  country context. This presentation covers USAID’s health supply chain 
  forecasting methods and mechanisms including this competition’s organization 
  and running, presentation of results, the top-performing methods and other 
  major findings.</div>

          <div class="card-body">As artificial intelligence tools become more accessible and widely-used, 
  development organizations are increasingly turning 
  to forecasting tools in an effort to gain efficiency, 
  reduce risk, and respond more quickly in volatile 
  environments. At the same time, AI-based forecasting 
  carries risks of bias, overconfidence, 
  or misapplication, along with the reputational and 
  moral hazards of (imperfectly) predicting future events. 
  At the U.S. Agency for International Development, 
  we aim to strike a strategic balance between 
  adoption of tools that can improve our work 
  and caution about their limitations and potential 
  misuse. A key part of our approach is to pay 
  attention to the broader technology 
  ecosystem -- looking beyond a specific AI application
  to understand the societal, regulatory, 
  and economic context into which it is deployed. 
  This talk will walk through a few examples of 
  forecasting-related projects at USAID and what 
  we have learned from these experiences.</div>
